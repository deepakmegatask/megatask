			   <p class="text-left wow fadeInUp" style="font-size: 18px;" data-wow-delay=".25s">Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, Skype id, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information when needed to provide a service or product or carry out a transaction you have requested.

			   <p class="text-left wow fadeInUp" style="font-size: 18px;" data-wow-delay=".25s">Like many other commercial websites, the Mega Task Technologies website may use standard technologies, such as "cookies" and other HTML tools, to collect information about how you use the site or to record that you opened an email marketing message. As such, we may log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. See section entitled "Cookies" below...</p>
			   
			   <h4 class="text-left  text-left wow fadeInUp " style="font-weight: 600;font-size: 20px;" data-wow-delay=".20s">Cookies</h4>
			   <p class="text-left wow fadeInUp" style="font-size: 18px;" data-wow-delay=".25s">Some parts of the Mega Task Technologies website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited.</p>
			   
			   <p class="text-left wow fadeInUp" style="font-size: 18px;" data-wow-delay=".25s">If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of the Mega Task Technologies website if you do so.

			   <h4 class="text-left  text-left wow fadeInUp " style="font-weight: 600;font-size: 20px;" data-wow-delay=".20s">Notice</h4>
			   <p class="text-left wow fadeInUp" style="font-size: 18px;" data-wow-delay=".25s">When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection.

			   <p class="text-left wow fadeInUp" style="font-size: 18px;" data-wow-delay=".25s">In most cases we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in" prior to receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving such materials. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection.</p>
